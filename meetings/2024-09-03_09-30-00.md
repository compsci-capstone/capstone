## Discussion Items

### Project Ideas

1. **Open Source Meeting Bot API**

   - The team is considering developing an open-source meeting bot that can integrate with platforms like Zoom or Google Meet to automate transcription and summarization tasks.
   - There is no affordable, open-source solution for this, and the team sees it as a valuable project.
   - The potential integration of AI for transcription and meeting summarization is also discussed, with features that could be added later to enhance the tool.

2. **Obsidian Extension**

   - The idea is to create an extension for Obsidian that auto-suggests links to notes based on semantic analysis and vector embeddings of note content.
   - Discussion around the use cases for educational purposes, where linked notes could help users manage a large set of interconnected notes more effectively.
   - A concern was raised about similar tools already existing, but the group believes their implementation could offer unique features.

3. **Kumon Prize Pet Project**

   - This project involves upgrading a homework-tracking app for Kumon students, currently used by over 200 students.
   - The app needs a significant overhaul with improvements in both the front-end and back-end codebases, particularly to simplify the user interface and improve maintainability.

4. **Additional Ideas**
   - There was some discussion about a Softball Platform project and an X-ray platform project, but these ideas were deprioritized.
   - Other ideas, such as improving tools for state machines, were mentioned but did not garner enough support to move forward.

### Team Roles and Meeting Logistics

- The group agrees to a tentative meeting schedule of Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday at 9:30 AM to accommodate everyoneâ€™s availability.
- Discussion of project management tools led to the decision to use Linear for task tracking and communication.
- Sarah volunteers to act as the project manager, handling task organization through Linear.

## Action Items

- **Sarah**: Set up the Linear workspace for project management.
- **Anyone**: Investigate domain names and potential hosting for the project.
- **Anyone**: Look into the requirements for developing the meeting bot's control plane.
- **Anyone**: Research integrations with Zoom API and any potential limitations.
